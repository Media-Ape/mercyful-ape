4.modify your {SICKBEARD_ROOT}/lib/tvdb_api/tvdb_api.py file so that:
5. self.config('url_base') = "http://localhost/mercyful-beard/hook.php?q="

6. Add any conversion files in mercyful-beard/data/
7. Add your shows in sickbeard.

EXTENDING:
Extending is real simple:
1. in mercyful-beard/data/ there is a collection of {series_id}.php files.
   if you show is not included, you'll need:
     - series_id
     - the number of episodes in each season (including "specials") for both:
       - thetvdb.com api
       - scene
2. copy the example.php file and rename it to {series_id}.php.
3. modify the $tvdb and $scene arrays.

should be automatically used next time sickbeard queries for that show.
