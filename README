INSTALLATION:
Setup a webserver capable of running php.
cd {WEB_ROOT}
git clone https://github.com/MercyfulFate/mercyful-beard.git

modify your {SICKBEARD_ROOT}/lib/tvdb_api/tvdb_api.py file so that:
self.config('url_base') = "http://localhost/mercyful-beard/hook.php?q="

Add any conversion files in mercyful-beard/data/
Add your shows in sickbeard.

EXTENDING:
Extending is real simple:
in mercyful-beard/data/ there is a collection of {series_id}.php files.
if you show is not included, you'll need:
 - series_id
 - the number of episodes in each season (including "specials") for both:
    - thetvdb.com api
    - scene
copy the example.php file and rename it to {series_id}.php.
modify the $tvdb and $scene arrays.

should be automatically used next time sickbeard queries for that show.
